# 04) JavaScript: Code-Quiz
For this project, I had to build a responsive webpage of a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. I also worked with a Web API for the first time.

## User Story 
```
As a coding student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
## Appearance
The image below displays the website's appearance and functionality.
